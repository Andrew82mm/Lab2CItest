## Short Description

This is the first version of my lab work. Currently, the project includes three main classes that implement the basic logic of character interactions and provide the ability to conduct battles.

## Project Development Plans

In future versions of the project, significant expansion of functionality and improvement of gameplay is planned. The main areas of development include:

1. **Class Expansion**: New classes, inherited from the main ones, will be added, featuring unique abilities. More interesting opponents will also be implemented.

2. **Improved Character Interaction**: The logic of character interactions will be refined to make the gameplay more dynamic and engaging.

3. **New Game Modes**: New game modes are planned to be introduced, adding variety and increasing replayability.

4. **AI Improvements**: The artificial intelligence will be enhanced to provide players with more challenging and interesting battles.
